\section{Brief}
This week we are looking into architectures which
follow the pipeline architectural style.
Specifically, this week we will:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cover the basic concepts of a pipeline architecture.
    \item Explore a few interesting aspects of the way the 
        Bourne Again Shell (bash) is implemented and why it is suitable for the 
        pipeline style.
    \item Briefly look at one of the primary modern applications of the pipeline style,
        MapReduce.
    \item Explore how the traditional pipeline architecture of a compiler has evolved.
\end{enumerate}
