\section{Brief}
DevOps is a \link{portmanteau}{https://www.britannica.com/topic/portmanteau-word} of development and operations.
It is intentionally a portmanteau to emphasise that the approach requires a close integration
of development and operations behaviours in one team.
In a proper DevOps environment the development team is responsible for the infrastructure on which their software runs,
not just for the software itself.
This can include considering infrastructure costs in their development budget and estimates.

This week we will
\begin{enumerate}
    \item provide an overview of DevOps,
    \item consider best practices,
    \item review some DevOps tools, and
    \item let you explore how you might implement DevOps processes.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Introduction to DevOps}
You should be familiar with the concepts of automated testing and continuous integration.
We will now extend that to include continuous testing and deployment,
and then expand on these to provide a full DevOps process.

For an introduction to DevOps read the article \link{``DevOps''}
{https://search.library.uq.edu.au/permalink/f/tbms52/TN_cdi_webofscience_primary_000383092600018}
published in IEEE Software.

Skim through the description of implementing DevOps at Wotif\footnote{Now Expedia} in
\link{``DevOps: Making it Easy to Do the Right Thing.''}
{https://search.library.uq.edu.au/permalink/f/tbms52/TN_cdi_webofscience_primary_000383092600012CitationCount}
Focus on the section titled ``Making it Easy.''
This is where they discuss how they provided the environment to support DevOps.


\section{Best Practices}


\section{DevOps Tools}
You should be familiar with some of the tools used in a DevOps process.
We will summarise the types of tools that enable DevOps.
We expect that you will do a quick Google search to get a summary of tools that are available.


\section{DevOps in Practice}
Read \link{``DevOps Capabilities, Practices, and Challenges: Insights from a Case Study,''}
{https://search.library.uq.edu.au/permalink/f/tbms52/TN_cdi_arxiv_primary_1907_10201}
published in the 2018 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering conference proceedings.

For the Sahara eCommerce case study, describe the process of delivering the system using DevOps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What types of tools would be required?
    \item Which specific tools would you choose?
    \item On which type of computing infrastructure would you deliver the system?
    \item What parts of the deployment and operations processes could be automated?
\end{enumerate}
