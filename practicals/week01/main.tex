    \item Enrol in
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item AWS Academy Cloud Foundations [10906] course;
        \item AWS Academy Learner Lab - Foundation Services [10909] course; and
        \item AWS Academy Learner Lab - Foundation Services [XXXXX] course.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Navigate the AWS Academy interface.
    \item Enter the AWS Console from an AWS Academy lab.
    \item Use the AWS Console to provision an EC2 instance with a simple web interface.
\end{itemize}

\todo{Need to be sure we're using AWS Academy before continuing.}
