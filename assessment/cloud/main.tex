\section*{Summary}
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to \textsl{design},
\textsl{implement}, and \textsl{deploy} a web API that can process a high load,
i.e. a scalable application.
You will be asked to deploy an API for booking concert tickets,
generating printed tickets, and generating seating plans.
Specially you need to support:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Purchasing of tickets via API requests.
    \item Generation of printed tickets and seating plans for existing tickets.
    \item Access via a specified REST API for use by front-end interfaces.
    \item Remaining responsive to the user while generating speech.
\end{itemize}

Your service will be deployed to AWS and will undergo automated correctness and load-testing to ensure it meets the requirements.

\section{Introduction}
Recent controversy has brought attention to the monopoly held by certain ticketing companies.
In hopes of a eventual collapse of the current monopoly,
we aim to develop, TicketOverflow,
an online concert ticket booking system.

\paragraph{Task}
For this assignment,
you are working for TicketOverflow,
a new competitor in the online ticket booking space.
TicketOverflow uses a microservice based architecture to implement their new platform.
The CEO saw that you took Software Architecture on your resume and has assigned you to design and implement the ticket service,
as this service must be scalable to cope with a large influx of bookings.

\paragraph{Requirements}
As you may be aware,
ticket booking platforms have intense peaks of traffic.
At the scale that TicketOverflow hopes to operate,
it would be inappropriate to run the servers required to meet demand at all times.
Thus, our service must be elastic --- able to scale up to meet demand and able to scale down to preserve costs.

\section{Interface}
As you are operating in a microservice context,
other service providers have been given an API specification for your service.
They have been developing their services based on this specification so you must match it exactly.

The interface specification is available to all service owners online:
\url{https://csse6400.uqcloud.net/assessment/ticketoverflow}

\section{Implementation}
The tool to generate appropriately styled printed tickets and seating plans has already been developed by the companies UX team.
Your investors have taken a liking to the designs generated by this tool.
Unfortunately, the tool developer has quit and the tool can run quite slowly,
so you will have to work around this bottleneck in the design and development of your system (you are not allowed to reimplement or modify this tool).

Your service must utilise the \texttt{hamilton} command line tool provided for this assignment.
You may not make any modifications to this tool.
The compiled binaries are available on the tools GitHub repository:
\url{https://github.com/CSSE6400/hamilton}

\section{Submission}
Your solution must committed to the GitHub repository specified in Section \ref{sec:github}.
Committing to this repository will be disabled after \textbf{16:00 (AEST) on 12 May 2022} and the contents of the repository at this time will be taken as your submission.
The repository \textbf{must} contain everything required to successfully deploy your application.
You must include all of the following in the repository:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Your implementation of the service API, including the source code and a mechanism to build the service.%
  \footnote{If you are using external libraries, ensure that you pin the versions to avoid external changes breaking your application.}
  \item Terraform code that can provision your service from a fresh AWS Learner Lab environment.
  \item A \texttt{deploy.sh} script that can use your Terraform code to deploy your application.
    This script can perform other tasks as required.
\end{itemize}

When deploying your application to mark,
we will follow reproducible steps, outlined below.
You may re-create the process yourself.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Your Git repository will be checked out locally.
  \item AWS credentials will be copied into your repository in the top-level directory,
  in a file called \texttt{credentials}.
  \item The script \texttt{deploy.sh} in the top-level of the repository will be run.
  \item The \texttt{deploy.sh} script \textbf{must} create a file named \texttt{api.txt} which contains the URL where your API is deployed to, e.g. \texttt{http://my-lb.com/}
  \item We will run automated functionality and load-testing on the URL provided in the \texttt{api.txt} file.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Important Note: 
Ensure your service does not exceed the resource limits of AWS Learner Labs.
For example, AWS will deactivate your account if more than 15 EC2 instances are running.}

\subsection{GitHub Repository}\label{sec:github}
You will be provisioned with a private repo on GitHub for this assignment, via GitHub Classroom.
You must click on the link below and associate your GitHub username with your UQ student ID in the Classroom.

\url{https://classroom.github.com/a/ZW_8y-7G}\\
Associating your GitHub username with another student's ID,
or getting someone else to associate their GitHub username with your student ID, is \link{academic misconduct}
{https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/student-integrity-and-conduct/academic-integrity-and-student-conduct}.

If for some reason you have accidently associated your GitHub username with the wrong student ID,
contact the course staff as soon as possible.

\subsection{Tips}

\paragraph{If something goes wrong}
Ideally, your infrastructure will be deployed successfully but this could go wrong for any number of unforeseen reasons.
If something does go wrong during deployment,
teaching staff will refer to your \texttt{README.md} file to attempt to resolve the issue where possible.
Please ensure that your \texttt{README.md} documentation is of high quality to allow yourself the best chance for recovery.

\paragraph{Terraform plan/apply hanging}
If your \texttt{terraform plan} or \texttt{terraform apply} command hangs without any output,
check your AWS credentials.
Using credentials of expired learner lab sessions will cause hanging.

\paragraph{Fresh AWS learner lab}
Your AWS learner lab can be reset using the reset button in the learner lab toolbar.
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/reset-button.png}
To ensure that you are not accidentally depending on anything specific to your learner lab environment,
we recommend that you reset your lab prior to final submission.
Note that resetting the lab can take a considerable amount of time,
in the order of hours, you should do this at least 4 to 6 hours before the submission deadline.
Please do not wait to the last minute.

\paragraph{Deploying with Docker}
In this course,
you have been shown how to use Docker containers to deploy on EC2/ECS.
You may refer to the practicals for how to deploy with containers \cite{prac-week5}.

%\paragraph{Unique S3 buckets}
%You may find it helpful to use S3 buckets for this assignment.
%It is important to be aware that the name of an S3 bucket has to be \textsl{globally} unique.
%To avoid any deployment conflicts,
%we recommend that you use the \texttt{random\_string} Terraform resource.
%This allows you to generate a random string which can be appended to the S3 bucket name.

%\begin{code}[language=terraform]{}
%resource "random_string" "bucket-name" {
%    length    = 16
%    special   = false
%    upper     = false
%}

%resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
%    bucket = "my-bucket-${random_string.bucket-name.result}"
%}
%\end{code}

%\paragraph{S3 pre-signed URLs}
%If you are using AWS S3,
%ensure that you consider the security aspects of storing your files.
%You do not want to make your S3 bucket publicly accessible.
%A good middle-ground is to use \link{pre-signed URLs}{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html} which allow you to generate temporary URLs that have read access to an object in an S3 bucket, e.g.

%\begin{code}[language=python]{}
%import boto3
%url = boto3.client('s3').generate_presigned_url(
%  ClientMethod='get_object', 
%  Params={'Bucket': BUCKET_NAME, 'Key': OBJECT_KEY},
%  ExpiresIn=3600
%)
%\end{code}

\paragraph{Authenticating AWS resources from EC2}
You may find it helpful to access other AWS resources,
such as SQS from an EC2 instance.
AWS offers \link{libraries to handle this communication}%
{https://aws.amazon.com/tools/},
however you will need to authenticate to access the resources.

You can give the EC2 instance the built-in IAM instance profile,
\texttt{LabInstanceProfile} \link{using Terraform}%
{https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance\#iam_instance_profile}.
This profile will provide your EC2 instance with access to all AWS resources on the account.

%\paragraph{URL Validity}
%The URL returned from the API to access the printed ticket or seating plan
%only needs to be valid for four hours after initial generation.
%You may assume the URL will not be used after that period.
%This may be helpful if you are using signed URLs.

\subsection{Fine Print}
You can reproduce our process for deploying your application using our \link{Docker image}{https://ghcr.io/CSSE6400/csse6400-cloud-testing}:
\codefile[language=docker]{Dockerfile}{deployment/Dockerfile}

Our steps for deploying your infrastructure using this container are as follows.
\texttt{\$REPO} is the name of your repository, and
\texttt{\$CREDENTIALS} is the path where we will store our AWS credentials,
\begin{code}[language=shell]{}
$ git clone git@github.com:CSSE6400/$REPO
$ cp $CREDENTIALS $REPO
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(pwd)/$REPO:/workspace csse6400-cloud-testing
$ cat $REPO/api.txt # this will be used for load-testing
\end{code}

\noindent
Note that the Docker socket of the host has been mounted,
this enables running \texttt{docker} in the container.
This has been tested on MacOSX and Linux but might require WSL2 on Windows.


\section{Criteria}
Your assignment submission will be assessed on its ability to support the specified use cases.
Testing is divided into functionality testing and quality testing.
Functionality testing is to ensure that your backend software and API meet the MVP requirements by satisfying the API specification without any excessive load.
Quality testing is based upon several likely use case scenarios.
The scenarios create different scaling requirements.

Partial marks are available for both types of tests,
i.e. if some functionality is implemented you can receive marks for that functionality,
or if your service can handle 80\% of the load during quality testing you will receive marks for that.

\subsection{Functionality}
You will be awarded 40\% of the total marks for a correct implementation of the API specification without being able to cope with excessive load.
A suite of automated API tests will assess the correctness of the implementation, via a sequence of API calls.
Some tests from this suite will be made available before the assignment due date.

\subsection{Quality Scenarios}\label{sec:scenarios}
The remaining 60\% of the marks will be derived from how your service handles various scenarios.
These scenarios will require you to consider how your application performs under load.

\paragraph{Small concert}
As TicketOverflow is starting out,
it will need to scale to the size of a small concert.
Playhouse at QPAC is one of the first venues to sign up for the service.
Their customers purchase tickets in advance over a longer period of time.

\paragraph{Pre-sale for Hamilton}
Hamilton is now showing at the Lyric Theatre at QPAC and the pre-sale tickets are released for a limited time.
The tickets are in high demand, and there are a large number of customers trying to purchase tickets at the same time.

\paragraph{General sale for Hamilton}
The general sale for Hamilton has started, and there is a surge of customers trying to purchase tickets at the same time.
This leads to a high traffic volume on the website, which puts a strain on TicketOverflow.

\paragraph{Evening shows at QPAC}
All QPAC venues are now supported in TicketOverflow.
Each evening there are multiple concerts that run concurrently.
TicketOverflow must be able to handle a steady stream of parallel purchases, ticket generation, and seating plan generation.

\paragraph{Priority tickets}
Tickets recently went on sale for a large concert in 4 months time.
A portion of the ticket purchases are printing there tickets in advance.
Meanwhile an evening show for a smaller concert is starting in a few minutes.
The evening show attendees should be able to print their ticket without being impacted by the later concert.

\paragraph{Taylor Swift tour}
Taylor Swift has chosen TicketOverflow for the release of her eras tour.
It is estimated that there will be about 2.8 million purchases during this time.
Your service should do its best to remain responsive during the launch of the tour.


\subsection{Marking}
Functionality accounts for 40\% of the marks for the assignment.
This is split as 25\% for correct implementation of the provided API,
and 15\% for correct implementation generation of printed tickets and seating plans.
The simple queries in the API are worth much less of the mark compared to the API operations that require dealing with persistent data.

%Backend processing is the synchronous and asynchronous conversion of text to speech.
%Synchronous processing is worth 12\% and asynchronous processing is worth 8\%.
All functionality marks are based solely on correct implementation of the functionality,
as assessed by the automated functionality tests.

Scaling your application to deliver the quality scenarios accounts for the other 60\% of the marks.
The scenarios described in section \ref{sec:scenarios} provide guidance as to the type of scalability issues your system is expected to handle.
They are not literal descriptions of the exact loads that will be used.
Tests related to scenarios that involve more complex behaviour will have higher weight than other tests.

The scenarios will also evaluate whether your service is being wasteful in resource usage.
The amount of resources deployed in your AWS account will be monitored to ensure that your service implements a scaling up and scaling down procedure.

Scaling will be assessed via automated tests.
A small subset of these will be released shortly before the due date.
These tests may consume a significant portion of your AWS credit.
You are advised to be prudent in how many times you execute these tests.

You will be given advanced warning of when your submission will be tested.
The idea is that it will give you a window of opportunity to confirm that your system is running correctly in your account,
before we run the automated tests.
This will also give you the opportunity to resolve any production errors that occur during testing.
For this reason,
you should ensure that your service has appropriate observability so that you can identify issues and respond accordingly.

Please refer to the marking criteria at the end of this document.


\section{Academic Integrity}
As this is a higher-level course, you are expected to be familiar with the importance of academic integrity in general, and the details of UQ's rules.
If you need a reminder, review the \link{Academic Integrity Modules}
{https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/learnuq-blackboard-help/academic-integrity-modules}.
Submissions will be checked to ensure that the work submitted is not plagiarised.

This is an individual assignment.
You may not discuss details of approaches to solve the problem with other students in the course.
All code that you submit must be your own work.
You may not directly copy code that you have found online to solve parts of the assignment.
If you find ideas from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow), you must \link{cite and reference}{https://web.library.uq.edu.au/node/4221/2} these sources.
Use the \link{IEEE referencing style}{https://libraryguides.vu.edu.au/ieeereferencing/gettingstarted} for citations and references.
Citations should be included in a comment at the location where the idea is used in your code.
All references for citations must be included in a file called \texttt{refs.txt}.
This file should be in the root directory of your project.

Uncited or unreferenced material will be treated as not being your own work.
Significant amounts of cited material from other sources will be considered to be of no academic merit.

\paragraph{Semester break}
Your application will see decreased usage during the semester break.
Minimal students and staff may periodically query pre-generated speech when revising content.
During this period we might see traffic of not more than 20 parallel users,
querying read-only endpoints.

\paragraph{Exam revision}
During the 20 minutes prior to an exam of a larger course, such as CSSE1001,
you might expect the entire cohort, all one thousand users,
revising the content.
Revising the content will consist primarily of read-only requests.

\paragraph{Monday of exam block}
Courses with large enrollments tend to have their exam scheduled at the start of exam block.
This enables course staff the most possible time to mark these exam papers.
At 8am on Monday of exam block,
the 4 largest cohorts will begin using your service for revision.

In addition, teaching staff for exams later in the week have begun uploading revision material.
We might expect about 30 staff members to upload their one page course summaries,
about 3,500 characters each.

\paragraph{Teaching cancelled}
Queensland has seen `unprecedented' rainfall causing the university to flood.
The university admin have made the call to cancel teaching for the week.
Coordinators are responsible for disseminating this information to their students.
All 1,957 courses must send announcements averaging 100 characters (many exact copies of the suggested announcement),
to relay this information.

\paragraph{Reading list due date}
The library has a deadline for course coordinators to submit their course reading lists.
In this completely fictional example,
we can imagine that coordinators have left uploading their reading list until the last minute.
Suddenly your system receives a large amount of requests to generate the spoken version of textbooks (we will vastly under-estimate that textbooks are round 7,000 characters).
About 100 coordinators submit their reading list at the last minute.

\paragraph{In-semester Monday morning}
Each semester there are a small number of new courses running for the first time.
These courses, in an attempt to keep up with the passage of time,
upload the course material for the week on a Monday morning.
About 20 courses uploading 2,500 characters of material.
At the same time, many coordinators like to send our announcements on Monday mornings summarizing the weeks content.
These announcements are typically around 80 characters long and sent out by 75 or so coordinators.
