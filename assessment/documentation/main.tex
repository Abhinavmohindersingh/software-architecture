\section*{Summary}
In this assignment, you will be asked to practice and demonstrate your ability to
\textsl{understand} and subsequently \textsl{communicate} an architecture of an existing software project.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, you need to choose a suitable open source software project.
        The project must have non-trivial functionality and architecture.
\item You will then need to write a 2-4 page document (excluding appendices) which 
        effectively documents the architecture of the software project.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
The digital world relies heavily on open source software, as seen by the recent log4j vulnerability.\footnote{https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance}
Fortunately, open source developers often maintain high quality documentation for the users of their projects.
Unfortunately, many open source projects don't maintain high quality documentation of the architecture of their software projects.
This causes difficulty for developers who want to contribute to the project, as they first need to understand the project.

In this project, you have the chance to right this wrong.
Your task is to find an open source software project with a sufficiently complex architecture and document it.
You may optionally choose to share this documentation with the project developers,
the perspective of a project newcomer is often invaluable to the seasoned developers.

Before you start looking for projects, read through architecture documentations written by students at TU Delft:
\url{https://delftswa.gitbooks.io/desosa2016/content} and \url{https://delftswa.github.io}.

It would also be advantageous to read through one of the architecture descriptions in either volume of
The Architecture of Open Source Applications: \url{http://aosabook.org}.

\section{Finding a Project}
Criteria for the software project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The project cannot be covered by the tutorials or the TU Delft students above.
    \item At least one release within the last year.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Places to look for projects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GitHub explore page: \url{https://github.com/explore};
    \item Apache project list: \url{https://apache.org/index.html#projects-list};
    \item discuss with students in class;
    \item or, ask your tutor.
\end{itemize}

\section{Documentation Structure}

\begin{description}
    \item[Title] The name of the software project.
    \item[Abstract] An introduction to the context of the software project, explaining the software's functionality.
\end{description}
