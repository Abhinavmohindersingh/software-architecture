\title{Case Study Presentation}
\author{Richard Thomas \& Brae Webb}
\date{Semester 1, 2022}

\maketitle

\section*{Summary}
In this assignment, you will be asked to demonstrate your ability to
\textsl{understand}, \textsl{communicate}, and \textsl{critique} an architecture of an existing software project.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item You will present the key information about the architecture of the project you documented in your case study assignment to your practical class.
    \item This will include an updated critique of the architecture and any other relevant updates to the information originally provided in your report.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Introduction}
You will give a presentation describing the project you selected for the documentation assignment.
The intent is to give everyone in the course a broader view of how software architectures are used to solve problems.
Your presentation should take advantage of what you have learnt in this course since you submitted your documentation report.
This may allow you to provide a more insightful critique of the architecture or to provide a more accurate description of the project's architecture.


\section{Presentation Content}
You are free to structure your presentation however you wish, though you should use some form of slides to support the delivery of information.
Your presentation needs to deliver the following content.

\begin{description}
    \item[Title Slide] Name of the software project, and your name and student number.
    \item[Introduction] Describe the software project, explaining the its key functionality and target users.
    \item[Quality Attributes] Describe the quality attributes of most importance to the project.
    \item[Context] Provide an overview of the software system's context and its external dependencies.
    \item[Architecture] Describe the software's architecture.
    \item[Critique] Analyse the software's architecture, describing how well it delivers its ASRs\footnote{Architecturally Significant Requirements}.
    \item[Conclusion] Highlight the key points or lessons learnt about the software's architecture.
\end{description}

Your presentation should introduce the software project.
Give an elevator pitch style summary of what problem the project solves and its key features.
Describe which quality attributes you think are most important for the project, and why.
Describe the project's software architecture. Use appropriate views and notation to convey the important aspects of its architecture.
Summarise your critique of the software architecture, highlighting how well it supports delivering the project's architecturally significant requirements.

Your audience is other students in this course. You may assume the audience has knowledge of the course content,
though you should not assume they are familiar with the project you are describing.

\subsection{Citations \& References}
You may cite references in your presentation to support the points you are making.
These should be cited and referenced using the IEEE referencing style.
The final slide(s) of your presentation should include the references to any cited material.
You should display the reference slide(s) for about 3 seconds at the end of your presentation.
You are not required to speak to the reference slides,
aside from possibly thanking your audience for listening and stating these are your references.


\section{Presentation}
Presentations will take place in your practical class sessions during weeks 10 to 13.
You will have a \textbf{maximum} of eight minutes for your presentation, plus three minutes for questions.
There is no minimum time required for your presentation,
it is up to you to determine when you have described all relevant information about the software architecture within your eight minute limit.

If your presentation exceeds eight minutes, the marker will ask you to stop your presentation.
No content of your presentation past eight minutes will be marked.


\section{Identity Verification}
The presentation is an identity verified assignment.
You must make your presentation in-person.
The marked result of your presentation will be used to determine any caps applied to your grade.
(That means a late penalty on the submission of your slides will not affect the mark used to determine a grade cap.)
The first slide of your presentation \textbf{must} contain your full name, as recorded in UQ's student enrolment system, and student number.

\subsection{Online Identity Verification}
If you are presenting online, at the start of your presentation you \textbf{must} show your UQ student card (it does not matter if your UQ student card has expired),
or official government photo id that shows your full name.
Your id must be clearly visible for at least 3 seconds.
If a marker cannot view your card clearly enough, they will ask you to move it so it is clearly readable.

\begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{gbsn}
If your government id does not show your name in Roman characters,
as recorded in UQ's student enrolment system, you need to include a clear image of your government id on your first slide and a textual
representation of your name that can be selected and copied from your slide so that it may be pasted into a translator.
(e.g. If you use your China Resident Identity Card, you must provide clear images of the front and back
of the card. You also need to provide a textual representation of your name in Chinese characters, e.g. 蒙晶.)
\end{CJK*}

Your face must be visible throughout the presentation to show that you are the one speaking during the presentation.
This may be through Zoom's participants window.
If you cannot arrange for your face to be visible throughout the presentation,
you \textbf{must} contact the course coordinator before 3 May 2022 to discuss your constraints.

\subsection{On-Campus Indentity Verification}
If you are presenting on-campus, at the start of the practical session in which you are presenting
you \textbf{must} show the marker your valid UQ student card.
Like in an exam situation, if you have lost your student card
you must obtain a temporary identity verification document from the UQ student centre \emph{before} the presentation.


\section{Submission}
There are three components that make up your assessable content for the presentation.
These are the slides you use for your presentation, the presentation itself, and your evaluation of other presentations.

\subsection{Slides}
The slides for your presentation are to be submitted to a link provided on BlackBoard.
Your slides are due at \textbf{13:00 (AEST) on 3 May 2022}.
Late submission of your slides will result in a penalty of 2\% of the maximum possible marks for the presentation, per minute that they are late.
Regardless of any penalty applied to the presentation, \emph{even} if the penalty is 100\%,
you \textbf{must} still make your presentation in your allocated timeslot.

\subsection{Presentation}
The presentations will take place in the practical sessions during weeks 10 to 13.
You will be allocated a week in which you are to make your presentation.
Your presentation is to use the slides you submitted on the third of May.

If you do not deliver your presentation, your final grade will be capped at a failing grade.
If you are unable to attend your session to give your presentation due to exceptional circumstances,
you may apply to defer your presentation to another date.
You are not able to defer a deferred presentation.

\subsection{Peer Assessment}
You are expected to attend all presentations.
You are required to submit an evaluation of each presentation you observe.
Submission of \emph{meaningful} feedback for at least \textbf{90\%} of the presentations in your practical class
is required to obtain a mark of 40\% or higher in the presentation assessment.

An online form will be provided for you to submit your assessment for each presentation.
You must submit your assessment of each presentation separately in order for the system to record all of your assessments.

If you are unable to attend a practical session due to exceptional circumstances,
and miss viewing several presentations,
you may apply for a modified limit on the number of presentations you must assess.

\section{Academic Integrity}
As this is a higher-level course, you are expected to be familiar with the importance of academic integrity in general, and the details of UQ's rules.
If you need a reminder, review the \link{Academic Integrity Modules}{https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/it/learnuq-blackboard-help/academic-integrity-modules}.
Submissions will be checked to ensure that the work submitted is not plagiarised.
If you have quoted or paraphrased any material from another source, it must be correctly \link{cited and referenced}{https://web.library.uq.edu.au/node/4221/2}.
Use the \link{IEEE referencing style}{https://libraryguides.vu.edu.au/ieeereferencing/gettingstarted} for citations and your bibliography.

Uncited or unreferenced material will be treated as not being your own work.
Extensive quotation or minor rephrasing of material from cited sources should be avoided.
Significant amounts of cited material from other sources, even if paraphrased, will be considered to be of no academic merit.
In all cases, any material that you cite must support the arguments and points that you are making in your presentation.
