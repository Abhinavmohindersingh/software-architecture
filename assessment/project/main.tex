\section*{Summary}
Throughout the software architecture course,
you have learnt about a subset of quality attributes of concern to software architects.
You have also been exposed to a number of techniques to satisfy these attributes.
Now, as the capstone project, you are required to
\begin{itemize}
    \item propose a non-trivial software project,
    \item identify the primary quality attributes which would enable success of the project,
    \item design an architecture suitable for the aims of the project,
    \item deploy the architecture, utlising any techniques you have learnt in or out of the course, and
    \item evaluate and report on the success of the software project.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The successful completion of the project will result in three deliverables, namely,
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item a proposal of a software project, the proposal must clearly indicate and prioritise two or three quality attributes most {\color{red} fundamental} to the project's success,
    \item the developed software, as both source code, and a deployed artifact, and
    \item a report which evaluates the success of the developed software relative to the chosen quality attributes.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Your software deliverable will include all supporting software (e.g. test suites or utilities) that are developed to support the delivered software.

\section{Introduction}
We have looked at several core quality attributes in this course.
These attributes were picked because they are the primary concerns of many real-world software projects.
In this project, we will have an opportunity to explore some of the fun of industry.
You will take the role of an entrepreneur, software architecture, developer, and operations team.

Your first role as an entrepreneur will be to utilise some creativity and think of a software project that interests you.
Your proposed project does not have to be profitable, nor does it have to be unique.
If you are struggling to think of a project, consider what annoys you in your day-to-day life, consider if software might help ease the annoyance.
Alternatively, look at existing everyday software like Netflix, TikTok, VSCode, or otherwise.
You are welcome to create off-brand versions of any existing software,
there are no marks for whether the software would be profitable or successful.
The lone requirement of your project is that, to function appropriately, it must demonstrate two or three of the quality attributes 
explored in this course\footnote{No, simplicity is not allowed.}.

Briefly, these attributes are:
\begin{description}
    \item[Availability] The software is available to access by end users, either at any time or on any platform, or both.
    \item[Deployability] The required computing infrastructure for the software can be easily provisioned, including updating both the infrastructure and the software.
    \item[Extensibility] Features or extensions can be easily added to the software over its lifespan.
    \item[Interoperability] The software can easily share information and exchange data with internal components and other systems.
    \item[Maintainability] The software is designed to be cost effectively modified over its lifespan.
    \item[Modularity] Components of the software are separated into discrete modules.
    \item[Reliability] The software consistently delivers its functionality without failure. You would need to define what ``consistently'' means for your system and how it will be measured.
    \item[Scalability] The software is simultaneously usable by a large number of end users and is economical to deliver with varying user loads.
    \item[Security] Software that maintains normal operations and functionalities even when subjected to attacks.
                             Systems and resources in its environment remain safe and the attacks are detected and mitigated.
    \item[Testibility] The software is designed so that automated tests can be easily deployed. This is beyond just automated unit testing.
\end{description}

\noindent
While security may be an appropriate quality attribute to use as the focus of your project,
all software systems must be developed to be ``secure enough'' for the context.
Conquently, it is expected that all projects will consider security,
even if it is not fundamental to the project's success.

Once you have settled on a project, write up a proposal for the project, as described in section \ref{sect:proposal}.
Before you get too far writing your proposal,
please try and discuss the idea with teaching staff,
this will help ensure you do not have to re-write it from scratch.


\section{Proposal}\label{sect:proposal}
Your proposal will answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is your project?
    \item Which quality attributes are most important and why?
    \item If trade offs are necessary, which attributes have higher priority?
    \item What are the basic features you plan to implement?
    \item How will you evaluate whether your project has the important quality attributes?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The proposal should not exceed two pages.
The suggested proposal structure is as follows.

\begin{description}
    \item[Title] Name for your project, get creative.
    \item[Author] Your name and student number.
    \item[Abstract] An elevator pitch to sell the project. This should highlight the quality attributes crucial to the project's success.
    \item[Functionality] Summary of the features delivered by the complete software product. This is what would be delivered if you built the entire system.
                                    Use this to sell why your project is fun or interesting.
    \item[Scope] Description of the fundamental functionality to be delivered as the \link{Minimum Viable Product (MVP)}{https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/}.
                         This is what you have to implement so be realistic!
    \item[Quality Attributes] A more detailed description of the quality attributes and why they are crucial to the project.
                                            They should be measurable and/or testable.
    \item[Evaluation] Description of how you will evaluate whether your project has achieved the desired attributes.
                                This is one of the most important parts of the proposal.
                                It must be clear how the evaluation will be done, and it must be feasible.
\end{description}


\subsection{Proposal Submission}

The following are \emph{important} details about how your proposal must be submitted.
Read the following carefully, misreading or misunderstanding the requirements does not except you from them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Your proposal \textbf{must} be written in \link{\textsl{markdown}}{https://www.markdownguide.org/}.
    \item Submission of the proposal component of the assignment will be via a GitHub repository%
             \footnote{It is important that you are continually keeping GitHub up to date with your progress.
              Keeping up to date will avoid the merge traffic jam near the due date.}.
    \item You will be provisioned a directory in the GitHub repository,
             where you should place your markdown files and any assets (images, code snippets, etc) that are included by the markdown files.
%    \item All markdown files in your directory will be joined together in alphabetical order, and this will be your final submission.
    \item You can preview your final submission in the \texttt{release} branch.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Below is a possible structure of your directory. Note the prefixed numbers to correctly order files.
Alternatively, you can write all content in one file.
