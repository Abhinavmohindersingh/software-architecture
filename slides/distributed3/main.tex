\questionanswer{What communication faults may occur?}{
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Message not delivered
        \item Message delayed
        \item Receiver failed
        \item Receiver busy
        \item Reply not received
        \item Reply delayed
    \end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Lost in transit
    \item Network delay or receiver overloaded, but message will be processed later
    \item Receiver software has crashed or node has died
    \item Receiver temporarily not replying (e.g. garbage collection has frozen other processes)
    \item Request was processed but reply lost in transit
    \item Reply will be received later
}

\questionanswer{How do we detect faults?}{
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item No listener on port -- RST or FIN packet
        \item Process crashes -- Monitor report failure
        \item IP address not reachable -- unreachable packet
        \item Query switches
        \item Timeout
    \end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Assumes node is running \& reachable. OS should close or refuse connection. Error packet may be lost in transit.
    \item Assumes node is running \& reachable. Most reliable.
    \item Router has to determine address is not reachable, which is no easier than for your application.
    \item Need permissions to do this. Will only have this in your own data centre.
    \item UDP reduces network transmission time guarantee -- does not perform retransmission
}

\questionanswer{What to do if fault is detected?}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Retry
        \item Restart
    \end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item How many retries? How often?
    \item Exponential backoff with jitter
    \item How long to wait to restart?
    \item Too long reduces responsiveness.
    \item Unacknowledged messages need to be sent to other nodes -- reducing performance.
    \item Too short may prematurely declare nodes dead.
    \item May lead to contention -- two nodes processing the same request.
    \item May lead to cascading failure -- load is sent to other nodes, slowing them down so they are then declared dead \dots.
}

\definition{Idempotency}{
    Repeating an operation does not change receiver's state.
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Idempotent consumer pattern
    \item Tag messages with an ID, so repeated messages can be ignored
    \item Or, redo messages that do not change state (e.g. queries)

            \item $n$ generals need to agree on plan
            \vspace{2mm}

    \item Link analogy to Byzantine faults
    \item Mention idea of Byzantine fault-tolerant systems
    \item e.g. safety critical systems, blockchain, \dots

\questionanswer{How to order asynchronous messages?}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Timestamps?
        \begin{itemize}
            \vspace{1mm}
            \LARGE\item Can't keep clocks in sync
            \vspace{1mm}
            \LARGE\item Limited clock precision
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Trying to sync with NTP is unreliable
    \item Network delays during sync
    \item Clock drift between syncs
    \item Finite precision -- two events may end up with the same timestamp, if they occur in quick succession
}

\point[Consistency]{
    \begin{description}
        \item[Eventual Consistency] weak guarantee
        \item[Linearisability] strong guarantee
        \item[Causal Ordering] strong guarantee
    \end{description}
}

\point[Linearisability]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Once value is written, all reads see same value
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item<1-> Regardless of replica read from
    \end{itemize}
    \item<2-> Single-leader replication
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item<2-> Read from leader
        \LARGE\item<2-> Read from synchronous follower
    \end{itemize}
    \item<3-> Multi-leader replication can't be linearised
    \item<4-> Leaderless replication
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item<4-> Lock value on quorum before writing
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Abstraction over replicated database
    \item Used when uniqueness needs to be guaranteed
    \item e.g. Multiple withdrawals from an account
    \item SLR -- defeats most performance benefits
    \item Leaderless -- similar performance cost to SLR
}

\point[Causal Order]{
\begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Order is based on causality
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item<1-> What event needs to happen before another
        \LARGE\item<1-> Allows concurrent events
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{3mm}
    \item<2-> Single-leader replication
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item<2-> Record sequence number of writes in log
        \LARGE\item<2-> Followers read log to execute writes
    \end{itemize}
    \item<3-> Lamport timestamps
\end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Linearisation defines a total order
    \item Causal ordering defines a partial order
    \item e.g. Git repo history with branching as causal order
    \item Not as strict as linearisability, so less performance cost

\definition{Consensus}{
    A set of nodes in the system agree on some aspect of the systemâ€™s state.
}
\note{Abstraction to make it easier to reason about system state.}

\point[Consensus Properties]{
\begin{description}
    \item[Uniform Agreement] All nodes must agree on the decision
    \item[Integrity] Nodes can only vote once
    \item[Validity] Result must have been proposed by a node
    \item[Termination] Every node that doesn't crash must decide
\end{description}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Uniform agreement and integrity are key
    \item Validity avoids nonsensical solutions (e.g. always agreeing to a null decision)
    \item Termination enforces fault tolerance, it requires that progress is made towards a solution
}

\definition{Atomic Commit}{
    All nodes participating in a distributed transaction need to form consensus to complete the transaction.
}
\note{Based on transaction atomicity from ACID.}

\point[Two-Phase Commit]{
\begin{description}
    \item[Prepare] Confirm nodes can commit transaction
    \item[Commit] Finalise commit once consensus is reached
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item Abort if consensus can't be reached
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
}

\image[trim=55 70 420 30,clip,height=\textheight]{../../notes/distributed3/diagrams/2phase-commit-seq.png}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Transaction ID used to track writes
    \item Prepare does all steps of a commit, aside from confirming it -- It cannot be revoked by participant
    \item Commit intent is recorded in log before sending to participants
    \item Even if a particiant fails, commit can proceed when it recovers
    \item Comment on performance costs
