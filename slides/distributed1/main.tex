\point[Focus]{Reliability}

\question{What makes software \highlight{unreliable}?}

\point[`Working' software]{Satisfies the functional requirements}

\definition{Reliable Software}{Continues to work correctly, even when things go wrong.}

\definition{Fault}{Something goes wrong.}

\quote[Howard and LeBlanc]{Death, taxes, and computer system failure are all inevitable to some degree.\\\highlight{Plan for the event.}}

\point[Reliable software is]{Fault tolerant}
    
\point[Problem]{Individual computers fail \highlight{all the time}}

\point[Solution]{Spread the risk of faults over \highlight{multiple computers}}

\point[Spreading Risk]{
    \large
    If you have software that works with \highlight{just one} computer,
    spreading the software over \highlight{two} computers \highlight{halves} the risk that your software will fail.
    \\[2em]
    \only<2->{Adding \highlight{10} computers reduces the cuts the risk by \highlight{10}.}
    \extra[3-]{Of course, there are other reasons you might want run software on multiple computers.}

\definition{Distributed Computing}{Multiple software components that are on multiple computers, but run as a single system}
