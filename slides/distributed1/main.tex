\note{We'll look at a few reasons that distributed systems are \highlight{fundamentally} quite challenging}

\section{Fallacies}

\point[A \textsl{few} reasons for complexity]{
    The Fallacies of \highlight{Distributed Computing}.
}
\note{Sun Microsystems in 1994, primarily accredited to Peter Deutsch (doy-ch)}

\point[Fallacy \#1]{The network is reliable.}

\image{diagrams/Success}
\note{Success: Send request to add item to cart.}

\image{diagrams/SendDrop}
\note{Failure 1: Request not received by server (CartService).}

\image{diagrams/SendDropResend}
\note{Failure 1: \textit{Solution} resend request?}

\image{diagrams/SendDropDos}
\note{If the service goes down and all clients are re-trying,\\ the service is in for a shock when it comes back,\\ we solve this with \highlight{exponential backoff}.}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Exponential Backoff}
\begin{code}[language=python,morekeywords={do}]{}
retries = 0
do:
    status = service.request()

    if status != SUCCESS:
        retries += 1
        wait(2 ** retries)
while (status != SUCCESS and retries < MAX_RETRIES)
\end{code}
\end{frame}

\image{diagrams/ReceiveDrop}
\note{Failure 2: Response not received.}

\image{diagrams/ReceiveDropResend}
\note[itemize]{
\item Failure 1's \textit{solution} of resending request leads to:
\item Duplicate actions, problem for ordering/payments.
}

\image{diagrams/ReceiveDropToken}
\note{Solution: Use tokens to prevent duplicates.}

\point[Fallacy \#2]{Latency is zero.}

\point[Network Statistics]{
    \begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{Data}]
        \item[Home to UQ] \only<2->{20.025ms}
        \item[Home to us-east-1] \only<3->{249.296ms}
        \item[EC2 to EC2] \only<4->{0.662ms}
    \end{description}
}
\note[itemize]{
\item Be mindful when designing distributed systems.
\item Network call \highlight{much} slower than local call.
}

\point[Fallacy \#3]{Bandwidth is infinite.}
\note{Similar to previous fallacy, be mindful,\\ distributed calls clog up network.}

\definition{Stamp Coupling}{
    Components which share a composite data structure.
}

\point[Fallacy \#4]{The network is secure.}

\image[height=1.07\textheight]{diagrams/Sahara}
\note{Authentication only occurs when entering Sahara data centre.}

\image[height=1.1\textheight]{diagrams/NetworkInjection}
\note[itemize]{
\item Bad actor gets access via one insecure node.
\item Network is compromised.
\item Practice defence in depth.
}

\point[Fallacy \#5]{The topology never changes.}
\note[itemize]{
\item Topology changes all the time, cloud just makes this easier.
\item Don't rely on static IPs.
\item Don't assume consistent latency.
}

\point[Fallacy \#6]{There is only one administrator.}
\note[itemize]{
\item Things spontaneously break.
\item Who can help you?
}

\point[Fallacy \#7]{Transport cost is zero.}

\point[Remember]{
\vspace{1em}
Distributed systems are \highlight{hard}.

\vspace{1em}
The choice to use them should be \highlight{well considered}.
}
\note{Can often introduce more problems than they solve.}

\point[When you need to, maybe prove it?]{

    \item Using Isabelle -- See CSS research sub-group.

\point[Or, more realistically,]{
    Use existing algorithms and software.

\question{What makes software \highlight{reliable}?}

\definition{Reliable Software}{Continues to work, even when things go wrong.}

\definition{Fault}{Something goes wrong.}

\quote[Howard and LeBlanc]{Death, taxes, and computer system failure are all inevitable to some degree.\\
\vspace{1em}\highlight{Plan for the event.}}

\point[Reliable software is]{Fault \highlight{tolerant}.}
\note{John von Neumann built fault tolerant hardware in the 1950s.}

\point[Problem]{Individual computers fail \highlight{all the time}.}
\note{10-50 years hard-drive lifetime. 10,000 disks will fail daily. Google last had 2.5 million servers.}

\point[Solution]{Spread the risk of faults over \highlight{multiple computers} or \highlight{nodes}.}

\point[Spreading Risk]{
    \Large
    If you have software that works with \highlight{just one} computer,
    spreading the software over \highlight{two} computers \highlight{halves} the risk that your software will fail.
    \\[2em]
    \only<2->{Adding \highlight{100} computers reduces the risk by \highlight{100}.}
}

\image[height=1.07\textheight]{diagrams/Sahara}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Why is this software somewhat reliable?
    \item Any individual service can go down and the rest still work.
    \item Can we do better?
    \item Can a service go down but have that service still work?
}

\question{Who has used \highlight{auto-scaling}?}

\point[Auto-scaling terminology]{
\Large
\begin{description}[<+->]
    \item[Auto-scaling group] A \highlight{collection of instances} managed by auto-scaling.
    \item[Capacity] Amount of instances \highlight{currently} in an auto-scaling group.
    \item[Desired Capacity] Amount of instances \highlight{we want to have} in an auto-scaling group.
    \item[Scaling Policy] How to determine the desired capacity.
    \item[Minimum/Maximum Capacity] \highlight{Hard limits} on the minimum and maximum number of instances.
\end{description}
}

\point[What we really want]{
    {\color{secondary}Desired Capacity} Amount of \highlight{healthy} instances we want to have in an auto-scaling group.
}

\point[Health check]{
    Mechanism to determine whether an instance is \highlight{healthy}.
}

\point[Auto-scaling]{An example}

\image[height=1.07\textheight]{diagrams/Sahara}
\note{Product Browsing service keeps going down}

\image{diagrams/ProductIsolate}
\note{We might expect product browsing to have a much higher load than other services}

\image{diagrams/ProductEC2}

\image{diagrams/ProductScale}
\note{Use an auto-scaling group to replicate the service}

\image{diagrams/ProductScaleReal}
\note{What's the problem?}

\image[width=\textheight]{diagrams/ProductScaleLB}
\note{Traffic was all sent through the one instance, load balancer routes to all}

\image[width=\textheight]{diagrams/SaharaScaled}

\begin{frame}{In Summary}
\Large
\begin{description}
    \item[Simplicity] \only<2->{\highlight{Minimal network communication} (compared to other distributed systems), less impacted by fallacies.}
    \item[Reliability] \only<3->{Traffic is spread to various services, still \highlight{partially operational} if one goes down. Auto-scaling allows for \highlight{basic replication}.}
    \item[Scalability] \only<4->{Auto-scaling and load balancing allows \highlight{individual services to scale}. However, the \highlight{database is a bottle-neck}.}  
\end{description}
\end{frame}
\note{\highlight{database is a bottle-neck} is foreshadowing}
