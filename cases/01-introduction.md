    The field of law is guided by the use of case studies.
    Court judges defer to the prior deliberations of their colleagues to influence the decision making.

    Within the field of Software Engineering, Software Architecture most closely resembles the laws profession.
    Software Architects are required to make imperfect case-by-case decisions based on the available facts of the case.
    Where allowed by individual company policies, architecture is a collaborative effort.
    Software Architects are not bound by the precedence set by their colleagues, however,
    we would argue that it is important to analyse and understand their decisions.

    In this booklet, we present a series of case studies on software architecture decisions.
    The intention of this is to provoke thought and elicit discussion on the quality of these decisions .
