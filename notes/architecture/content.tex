\section{Introduction}
An introduction to Software Architecture seems almost incomplete without an obligatory
discussion of what software architecture acutally means.
The term software architecture has been overloaded to describe a number of distinct concepts.
As such it is a difficult concept to define succinctly.
Martin Fowler wrestles with this difficultly in his ``Making Architecture Matter'' talk.\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DngAZyWMGR0}}
Eventually, he settles on the rather vague definition.

\begin{definition}[Software Architecture]
The important stuff; whatever that is.
\end{definition}

In this course, we narrow the scope.
We need a definition which encompasses numerous practical strategies which you need to survive and thrive in industry life.
This definition should not be attributed to the term `Software Architecture'; that term is much too broad to define succinctly.
This is purely the definition used to provide an appropriate scope for the course.

\begin{definition}[Software Architecture: The Course]
The collection of tools, processes, and design patterns which enable quality attributes to be met in software.
\end{definition}
