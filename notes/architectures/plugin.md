    Software projects which need to be highly interoperable, highly modifiable, or highly extensible,
    a plugin-based architecture is a natural fit.
    These architectures should be familiar, your browser likely implements the pattern, as does your IDE, and CI system.
    They enable a software system to act as a host for executing arbitrary programs which implement feature extensions.
