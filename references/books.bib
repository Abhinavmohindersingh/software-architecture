	abstract = {From the Publisher:This landmark 1971 classic is reprinted with new commentary and a Preface from the author. Long regarded as one of the first books to pioneer a people-oriented approach to computing,  The Psychology of Computer Programming  endures as a penetrating analysis of the intelligence, skill, teamwork, and problem-solving power of the computer programmer. Returning to topics that are strikingly relevant to today's issues in programming, Gerald M. Weinberg provides a characteristically fresh perspective on his original insights, highlighting the similarities and differences between now and then. Using a conversational style that invites the reader to join him, Weinberg reunites with some of his most enduring, straight-from-the-heart observations on the human side of software engineering. Dorset House Publishing is proud to make this important text available to new generations of Weinberg fans â€” and to encourage readers of the first edition to return to its valuable lessons.}
